## 1. Cache function
Waiting to be implemented.
It was not implemented... I had some doubts.
How it could be implemented? I thought that I would have to implement an MVC code.
This implementation was not clear for me.

If I had in a team group, I would request about the expectations and how it might work.

## 2. Date formatting
This feature allow the user access the time elapsed on real time

Working example:
